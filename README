These are the source codes of the network model of social integration that
we published in the paper "A network model of immigration: Enclave formation 
vs. cultural integration" on the AIMS journal of "Networks and Heterogeneous 
Media".

1. To compile the codes, open a terminal and run the following command line

      	      make adapt


2. To run the program, execute the following command:

      	      ./adapt input.txt

   adapt is the executable that we have just compiled;
   input.txt is an optional text file containing the parameter values of the model. 

   If an input file is not given, the simulation will run with default parameter
   values predefined in the program. 

3. I created several key functions for the graphic display:

     q: quit the program

     r: toggle between running and pausing the simulation

     l: turn the lines of connections on or off

     c: print the current number of clusters in the terminal
        (better to pause the simulation first)

     d: get the degree distribution (up to 20) at the moment
        (needs an output function to get the results; currently has no visible effects)


4. The source codes are in several different folders:
   Node/ --- codes related to the network configuration and the nodes
   Model/ --- codes related to the population model
   Graphics/ --- codes related to the visual display
   Stats/ --- codes related to the calculation of the statistics

5. The codes can be compiled with g++ in MacOS and in Linux. If you are using a different compiler, please modify GNUMakefile accordingly.

6. The program requires the OpenGL library for the graphic display. If OpenGL and OpenGL Utility Toolkit (glut) does not come with the installation of your operating system, please look up the instructions to install the library.
